1) why ece why not other branches
“I chose Electronics and Communication Engineering because it operates at the convergence 
of hardware, communication systems, and software. The discipline offers a scalable, future-ready
skill portfolio and enables participation across high-growth domains such as IoT, automation,
semiconductors, embedded systems, and even software engineering.

During my internship in Embedded C, I gained hands-on exposure to system-level development and
end-to-end communication between circuitry and software. Out of curiosity, I later explored 
full-stack web development and realized that I genuinely enjoy building and engineering solutions. 
That clarity helped me position development as my long-term career path.

Compared to other branches, ECE provides strategic flexibility—with opportunities in both
core hardware and software ecosystems. That versatility, combined with my interest in development,
is the reason I intentionally pursued ECE.”

2) Self Introduction 
Good morning/afternoon. My name is Anusha M G, and I’m from Bangalore, Karnataka.
I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Communication 
at STJIT, Ranebennur, with a CGPA of 8.24.

I have strong technical competencies in Java, JavaScript, Full Stack Development, 
Spring Boot, Microservices, and React. My hands-on experience spans HTML, CSS,
 Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Angular, Node.js, Express.js, REST APIs, MySQL, MongoDB,
 and version control using Git and GitHub. I also have working exposure to DevOps
  tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, CI/CD pipelines, and Jenkins.

I completed a Full Stack Development internship at Apponix Academy, Hubli,
 where I built responsive landing pages and enhanced frontend-to-backend integration
 \ capabilities. I also completed the Apna College Java + DSA and Full Stack certification,
  which strengthened my problem-solving and backend development fundamentals.

Some of my key projects include:

RoadReady – Car Rental Management System, built using Spring Boot and Angular
 with JWT authentication, REST APIs, and Swagger documentation.

Wanderlust – Full Stack Web Application, developed using Node.js, 
Express.js, and EJS with authentication and CRUD functionalities.

IV Drip Management System, an IoT solution using Embedded C,
 sensors, microcontrollers, and Blynk to automate fluid monitoring and alerting.

I am a proactive learner with strengths in communication, teamwork, 
adaptability, and analytical thinking.
 My career objective is to begin as a Full Stack or Software
  Developer, contribute to scalable, real-world applications,
   and continuously advance my technical expertise in a collaborative environment.

3) Why java is not 100% object oriented program
   1. Primitive Data Types — int, float, char, boolean, etc., are value types stored directly
       in memory, not objects.
       (If Java were 100% OOP, every data element would be an object.)

  2. Top-Level Non-OOP Features — main() must be static to run without object creation, 
    Why main() is static

    The JVM needs an entry point to start the program.
    At startup, no objects exist yet.
    If main() were non-static, the JVM would be forced to create an object first—but it wouldn’t know which constructor, what parameters, or what dependencies to supply.
    Making main() static allows the JVM to invoke it directly at the class level:
    public static void main(String[] args) { } which breaks pure object dependency.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) static keyword 
Why we use static

Improves memory efficiency (one copy shared)
Enables execution before object creation
Simplifies access to common resources
Supports procedural entry point (public static void main)

Important constraints
Static methods cannot access non-static variables/methods directly
(no object context available)
this and super cannot be used inside static methods
class Demo {
    int count = 10; // non-static (instance variable)

    static void display() {
        System.out.println(count); // ❌ compile-time error
    }
}
Why it fails
display() belongs to the class, but count belongs to an object. Without an object reference, 
the JVM has no instance to read count from.

class Demo {
    int count = 10;

    static void display() {
        Demo d = new Demo();    // create object
        System.out.println(d.count); // ✅ valid
    }
}

5) Difference between static and abstract method
| Static                                     | Abstract Method                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Keyword/modifier                           | Method type                                 |
| Class-level                                | Object/instance-level                       |
| Has implementation                         | No implementation                           |
| Cannot be overridden (true static methods) | Must be overridden                          |
| Accessible without object                  | Requires subclass object                    |
| Used for memory efficiency & utility logic | Used for design abstraction & extensibility |

**> Static Keyword

A modifier applied to variables, methods, blocks, or nested classes
Belongs to the class, not an object
Can be accessed without creating an instance
Used for shared data, utilities, constants, and entry points

class Util {
    static void log() {
        System.out.println("Logging...");
    }
}
// call
Util.log();

**> Abstract Method

A method declaration without implementation
Exists only inside an abstract class or interface
Must be implemented by child classes—supports polymorphism and design contracts
Cannot be static, final, or private because it requires overriding

abstract class Shape {
    abstract void draw();
}
class Circle extends Shape {
    void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing circle");
    }
}
✅ Core Purpose
static — used for class-level data or behavior; avoids repeated memory allocation.
abstract — used to define an incomplete method/blueprint to be implemented by subclasses.

✅ Memory & Execution
static members exist once per class (shared across all objects).
abstract methods have no implementation—memory allocation happens only after subclass object creation.

✅ Overriding & Polymorphism
static methods cannot be overridden—they are resolved at compile time (method hiding).
abstract methods must be overridden—supports runtime polymorphism.

✅ Polymorphism Support
static → no runtime polymorphism.
abstract → enables runtime polymorphism through overriding.

✅ Keywords & Usage
static keyword for static methods, variables, blocks, nested classes
abstract keyword for abstract classes and abstract methods.

✅ extends vs implements
To use an abstract class, a subclass extends it.
To use an interface, a class implements it.
Interfaces also achieve abstraction, even without the abstract keyword—methods are implicitly abstract (except default/static).
