--> Arrays and Array

1. array (lowercase) → Built-in data structure

An array is a language-level feature in Java.
It is not a class.
It is a fundamental container that holds multiple values of the same type.

Example:
int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3};
char[] x = a.toCharArray();

Characteristics:

Fixed size
Stores elements directly
Index-based
Created using new or array literals
No built-in methods except .length field

Example operations:
numbers[0] // access element
numbers.length // array size

2. Arrays (capital A) → Utility Class
   Arrays is a class from java.util package.
   import java.util.Arrays;

This class provides static utility methods for working with arrays.

Common operations provided by Arrays:

Sorting → Arrays.sort(array)
Comparing → Arrays.equals(array1, array2)
Binary search → Arrays.binarySearch(array)
Filling → Arrays.fill(array, value)

Converting to string → Arrays.toString(array)

Example from your code:
Arrays.sort(x);
Arrays.sort(y);
Arrays.equals(x, y);

These are helper methods, not part of the array itself.

4. Simple Explanation

array → the actual storage box
Arrays → a toolbox containing tools to work on that box

NOTES ON STRING IMMUTABILITY & STRINGBUILDER (JAVA)

1. Strings Are Immutable in Java
   Definition

A String is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed after creation.

Any modification (concatenation, replace, substring, etc.) creates a new String object instead of modifying the existing one.

Why Strings Are Immutable

Security

Strings are used in sensitive areas: URLs, database connections, usernames, passwords, class loading.

If strings were mutable, someone could change these values after they are created, causing vulnerabilities.

String Pool Optimization

Java maintains a String Constant Pool (SCP) to reuse string objects.

If strings were mutable, sharing them safely across the pool would be impossible.

Thread-Safety

Immutable objects are automatically thread-safe.

Multiple threads can use the same String without synchronization.

HashCode Consistency

Strings are frequently used as keys in HashMap, HashSet.

If a String changed after insertion, the hashcode would change, breaking the collection.

Example of Immutability
String s = "hello";
s = s + "world";

"hello" cannot be changed.

"helloworld" is a new object, and s now refers to this new object.

The original "hello" remains unchanged.

2. StringBuilder (Mutable Class)
   Definition

StringBuilder is a mutable class used for efficient modification of strings.

Mutable means you can modify the content without creating new objects.

Why Use StringBuilder

Performance

Repeated string operations (append, insert, delete) do not create new objects.

Much faster than using String in loops.

Memory Efficiency

Modifies the same underlying buffer instead of creating new strings.

Important Methods

append(value) → Adds data to the end.

insert(pos, value) → Inserts data at a specific index.

delete(start, end) → Removes characters.

reverse() → Reverses the string.

toString() → Converts the builder content to a String.

Example
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
sb.append("Hello");
sb.append("World");
System.out.println(sb.toString());

Output:

HelloWorld

Only one object is modified.

No extra strings are created.

3. Difference Between String and StringBuilder
   Feature ->String -StringBuilder
   Mutability ->Immutable - Mutable
   Performance -> Slow in loops - Fast for modifications
   Thread Safety-> Yes - No
   Memory usage ->Higher - Lower
   Usage Constant or fixed text - Dynamic text building
4. When to Use What
   Use String when:

Value will not change.

You work with constants, keys, config values.

Use StringBuilder when:

You are building text dynamically.

You are appending inside loops.

You want optimized performance.

5. One-Line Summary

String = Immutable, safe, shared, slow for modifications

StringBuilder = Mutable, efficient for building and modifying strings
